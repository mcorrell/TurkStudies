    <h3>Perception of Correlation</h3>
    <div>
    <p>
    Sometimes, two different variables are <i>related</i>. That is, a change in one is connected with a change in the other. For instance, there is a relationship between the seasons and the temperature: it is colder in the winter, and warmer in the summer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <i>Regression analysis</i> is a field of statistics that tries to find and describe these relationships. For instance, how a variable <i>X</i> (the dependent variable) is related to another variable <i>Y</i> (the independent variable). For this task, you will be asked to <i>visually estimate</i> the relationships between variables in a scatterplot. In general, how does Y (the vertical position of points) change with X (the horizontal position of points).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Not all relationships are equally strong. For this task, we are asking you to estimate the general trend. This may be difficult if the relationship is weak.

<div class="figure">

    <span>A strong <i>positive</i> relationship between points. As X increases, Y increases</span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="./imgs/weakline.png" />
    <span>A weaker <i>positive</i> relationship. The general trend is the same as in the other figure.

    <p>You will see a scatterplot with a purple line drawn over it. Using the slider, adjust the purple line until it matches what you see as the general trend of the points. Moving the slider to the right will cause the purple line to bend or curve upwards, and to the left will cause it to bend or curve downwards. Try to find the relationship that best matches the points in the scatterplot.
